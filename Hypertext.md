**HTML-Hypertext Markup Language**

 HTML is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets called HTM elements. Elements are typically made up of opening and closing tags.
<html></html> Anything between the tags is HTML code.
<body></body> Anything between the tags should be shown in the browser window.

Attributes provide additional info about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of a name and value, separated by an equal sign.

Content Management Systems (CMS) offer tools that allow you to edit template files.

Since there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with
a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character).
It is important that no two elements on the same page
have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is
no longer unique).

The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

The <iframes> tag cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

The <meta> tag allows you to supply information about your web page. 
The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element. The most common attributes
are the name and content attributes, which tend to be
used together. These attributes specify properties of the entire
page. The value of the name attribute is the property you
are setting, and the value of the content attribute is the value
that you want to give to this property.

The description is commonly used by search engines to understand what the
page is about and should be a maximum of 155 characters.

The keywords contain a list of comma separated words that a user
might search on to find the page.
