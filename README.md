Hello world. This is Sharonese. I am taking Web Dev4 with Pivot Tech in Nashville.
## Growth Mindset

**Perseverence and a can do attitude are my way of describing a growth mindset. _Never quitting until the job is done,_ is a great mantra.**

1. Be willing to take constructive criticism
2. Do not compare yourself to others
3. You will get better with effort and practice
