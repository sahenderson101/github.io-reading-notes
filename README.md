# Bio

I am an aspiring Front-end Web Developer in Nashville, TN. I have broad experience in project management, hardware and software implementation, systems integration, and courseware development. All of my experience has been at the application support level. I would now like to added coding to my skill set to eventually teach our youth tech skill that can sustain them in a variety of career choices. Every person and every job needs tech.
