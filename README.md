# Bio

I am an aspiring Front-end Web Developer in Nashville, TN. I have broad experience in project management, hardware and software implementation, systems integration, and courseware development. All of my experience has been at the application support level. I would now like to added coding to my skill set to eventually teach our youth tech skill that can sustain them in a variety of career choices. Every person and every job needs tech.


## Growth Mindset

**Perseverence and a can do attitude are my way of describing a growth mindset. _Never quitting until the job is done,_ is a great mantra.**

1. Be willing to take constructive criticism
2. Do not compare yourself to others
3. You will get better with effort and practice
