### Text Editor

Reflection and Discussion
A text editor allows you to write and manage the text needed to build a web site. 

Some of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a variety of themes; and 4.) a selection of extensions.

With **code completion**, once you start typing, possible suggestions will display based on what you typed.

**Syntax highlighting** takes the text you type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing it. Attributes are a different color than elements. Elements are a different color than 
than copy. This makes the text easier to read and to find errors. 

**Themes** will allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor and the series of colors in your text. Web developers typically use a dark background and
brightly colored text, which is known to be easier on your eyes.

**Extensions** are like plugins for your text editor. Extensions will allow you to add functionality as you need it.

You can use the text editor that come with your computer, there will be no syntax highlighting, no themes and no extensions. 

The text editors, of which I were aware, were Notepad++ and Atom. There are many others like Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Brackets, and Sublime Text.

Most of this software can be download from their web sites for free and are widely used in web development.
